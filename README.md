# 🕒 Dynamic Timetable Generator

## 📖 Overview
The **Dynamic Timetable Generator** is a web application built with **.NET Core MVC** that allows users to generate a **randomized school/college timetable** based on user-defined inputs such as:
- **Number of working days**
- **Subjects per day**
- **Total subjects and allocated hours**

The system ensures **random subject distribution**, preventing repetition in a single day, and dynamically fills the timetable.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Client & Server-Side Validations** – Uses jQuery & ModelState for error handling.  
✅ **Responsive UI** – Styled with Bootstrap for a clean look.
